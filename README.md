To make it easy for you to clone the repository, here's a list of recommended next steps.

Start off by cloning the project onto your personal computer:
1. Open your terminal
2. Move to the file in which you want the project to be saved in (using 'cd _foldername_')
or Make your folder ('mkdir _foldername_') then move into it the newly created folder
3. Once in the file, copy and paste the following link and press enter:
git clone _____my repos ssh clone id_____
4. You now have access to edit and update the code


## <strong>Description<br></strong>
I decided to create an online Diary as my first attempt to create a webpage using Python, Html and Flask.<br>
Thought Process:
    Welcome:
        Should have an aesthetically pleasing theme on the welcome page, with a welcome message and instructions on what to do next.
        From there a user will be asked to enter their email address to login
        Fail:
          Prompt user for correct details
        Success:
          Continue to the next page(Login page)
    Login:
        Basic login page which requests username and password
        2 Buttons set up [sign in] and [forgot-password]
          considering adding [cancel] button which will send us back to the homepage
          Fail:
            Prompts user to input correct details
          Success:
            Continues onto the next page(Users homepage) with their entries listed
              Personalization of profile picture would be an added bonus I hope to accomplish
    Homepage:
        Customization to be added at some point before this project is complete
        Hoping to set up a Calendar API which is linked to the users diary
          This will allow for users to input a diary entry with a reminder on a specific day/time in which they want to review their entry
          Title and date will be shown on the homepage blocks(diary entries will only be shown once user clicks on title/date)
          user should have the ability to add/delete or edit their diary entry
          They should also be able to share their entries

## <strong>Badges<br></strong>
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## <strong>Installation<br></strong>
Since this code is still in the backend/production process. It can only be run from the localhosts terminal once cloning the repository. I will later publish the site and make it live once I am happy with the information available and layout.

## <strong>Support<br></strong>
If you are having any issues with the webpage, please feel free to contact any one of our lead developers:<br>
